"""
What is the time complexity in Big-O notation of the following code snippets?
You can assume that mathematical operations (eg. **, %, + ) take a constant time.

# Snippet 1: O(n)
# Iterates through each element once to apply the square operation
map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)

# Snippet 2: O(n)
# Iterates through each element once to check if it's even
filter(lambda x: x % 2, numbers)

# Snippet 3: O(n)
# Iterates through each element once to accumulate the sum
reduce(lambda x,y: x + y, numbers)
